# Guild Tycoon

Guild Tycoon is a game prototype about creating an adventurer guild in a heroic fantasy universe.

The game is unfinished and unpolished, and saves state to the local browser.

The prototype is playable at : https://mark-poussard.github.io/guild-tycoon-alpha/

This could be considered a precursor game to [Monsters & Mayors](https://monsters-and-mayors.com/)

## How to play

### Quests

Complete quests using the **quests** tab to gain money, experience points and gems.

### Heroes

You can then use experience points to level up adventurers on the **Heroes** tab (using the green + button next to the adventurers level).

### Call For Heroes

Gems can be used on the **Call For Heroes** tab to attract a random new heroe to your guild.

### Equipment

Each heroe has an equipment popup that allows the user to equip any valid item in the guild's inventory by either drag and dropping to an empty equipment slot or by double clicking the item.
